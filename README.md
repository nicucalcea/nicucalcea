### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Journalist at BBC News. I develop [R libraries](https://github.com/nicucalcea?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=r&sort=stargazers) and [Obsidian plugins](https://github.com/nicucalcea?tab=repositories&q=obsidian&type=&language=&sort=stargazers).

You can read more about me [on my website](https://nicu.md/), and I also write a [data journalism blog about Eastern Europe](https://blog.samizdata.co/).

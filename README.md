### Hello 👋

I'm a Data Journalist at BBC News. I develop [R libraries](https://github.com/nicucalcea?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=r&sort=stargazers) for work and [Obsidian plugins](https://github.com/nicucalcea?tab=repositories&q=obsidian&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) for fun.

You can see some samples of my work on [on my website](https://nicu.md/), and I also write a [data journalism blog about Eastern Europe](https://blog.samizdata.co/).

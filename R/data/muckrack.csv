Pubs, restaurants and catering services, for example, were spending an average of 8.8 per cent of their budget on electricity in 2018. Without government support, that figure is expected to rise to 20.6 per cent in October 2022 when the energy price cap is increased. Hospitality businesses will be particularly badly affected."

And this praise wasn’t entirely unfounded. Over a third of the Chilean population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by now, with over a fifth being fully vaccinated. Few countries can boast of such an impressive performance: among those with over one million people, only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have administered more doses per 100 people."

The EU, by contrast, would only lose around 0.5 per cent of its GDP."

            <h2>About Transmetropolitan</h2>
            <p>Transmetropolitan is a cyberpunk transhumanist comic book series written by Warren Ellis and co-created
                and designed by Darick Robertson; it was published by the American company DC Comics in 1997-2002. The
                series was originally part of the short-lived DC Comics imprint Helix, but upon the end of the book's
                first year the series was moved to the Vertigo imprint after DC Comics shut down their Helix imprint.
                Transmetropolitan chronicles the battles of Spider Jerusalem, infamous renegade gonzo journalist of the
                future.</p>
            <p>Spider Jerusalem dedicates himself to fighting the corruption and abuse of power of two successive United
                States presidents. He and his "filthy assistants" strive to keep their world from turning more dystopian
                than it already is while dealing with the struggles of fame and power, brought about due to the
                popularity of Spider via his articles.</p>
